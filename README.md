# server_42
This is a System Administration subject. The purpose is to discover Docker and set up a web server.

The script directory contains four "docker scripts/commands".

The first one create an image, the second one run a container, the third one stop all containers and the last one stop containers and remove all images.

One you execute the script "run_container.sh" you will be in the the bash. From there you can execute from anywhere the commande autoindex_on or autoindex_off.

Enjoy
